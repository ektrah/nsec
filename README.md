[NSec](https://nsec.rocks/) is a new cryptographic library for
[.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/) based on
[libsodium](https://libsodium.org/) &#x2764;.
It provides modern cryptographic primitives in a modern API based on
[the new `Span<T>` and `ReadOnlySpan<T>` types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2017/connect/csharp-all-about-span-exploring-a-new-net-mainstay).
NSec aims to be easy to use, secure by default, fast, and agile.
