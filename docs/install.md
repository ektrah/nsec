# Installation

Use the following command to install the
[NSec.Cryptography NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NSec.Cryptography/24.9.0-preview.2):

    $ dotnet add package NSec.Cryptography --version 24.9.0-preview.2


## Supported Platforms

[NSec 24.9.0-preview.2](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NSec.Cryptography/24.9.0-preview.2)
is intended to run on all
[supported versions of .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core)
on the following platforms:

|                       | `-x64`   | `-x86`   | `-arm64` | `-arm`   |
|:----------------------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| **`android-`**        |          |          |          |          |
| **`ios-`**            |          |          | &check;  |          |
| **`linux-`**          | &check;  |          | &check;  | &check;  |
| **`linux-musl-`**     | &check;  |          | &check;  | &check;  |
| **`maccatalyst-`**    | &check;  |          | &check;  |          |
| **`osx-`**            | &check;  |          | &check;  |          |
| **`tvos-`**           |          |          | &check;  |          |
| **`win-`**            | &check;  | &check;  | &check;  |          |


Please note:

1. For Windows, the
   [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist)
   is required. This is part of the .NET SDK but might not be present on a
   clean Windows installation.

2. The AES-GCM implementation in NSec is hardware-accelerated and may not be
   available on all architectures. Support can be determined at runtime using
   the static `IsSupported` property of the `NSec.Cryptography.Aes256Gcm` class.
